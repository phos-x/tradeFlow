Summary I need a Python-based script that fetches real-time trading data from a public API 
and stores it in a structured format. 
The goal is to have a reusable script that I can run myself to update or fetch new trading data conveniently.

Deliverables:

A well-documented Python script that retrieves basic trading data (e.g., stock prices, volume, bid/ask prices) 
and outputs it into a CSV file.

Instructions on how to run the script and modify parameters 
(e.g., selecting different stock tickers, adjusting time intervals).

More specific details (e.g., the exact data fields, preferred data sources) 
will be discussed once we connect. 
I'm happy to provide the target API and a breakdown of required data before you start.

-------------

1) a python script
2) the api value should be adjustable
3) there should be a definition of real time data in the script (time frame)
4) there should be an option to update or fetch new data 
5)
